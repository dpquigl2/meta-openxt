This is an experimental repository for turning the OpenEmbedded meta data for OpenXT into a real OpenEmbedded layer instead of a clone of the repository. It is not usable to build OpenXT. The recipies needed by OpenXT will slowly be added to this repo as they are fixed to build against the latest OpenEmbedded master version.
